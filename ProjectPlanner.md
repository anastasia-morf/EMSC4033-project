# EMSC4033 Project Plan 

### Introduction to Python utilities for LiPD files

## Executive summary


The LiPD framework is standardized format for paleoclimate files, but can be difficult to navigate if you are not an experienced user. For this project, I will construct a generalised plotter notebook that can be used as a template for users to filter (e.g. spatially, temporally, types of proxy system) and assess records (e.g. time series within a particular temporal window) and metadata (e.g. publication information) from LiPD files/ databases as needed. This will be useful to users who are not familiar with the LiPD format, or want to quickly access data from databases without having to learn how to use data analysis packages such as Pyleoclim/GeochronR.
 

## Goals

I will create two Jupyter notebooks, which will achieve the goals of:
1) Teaching a user how to set up a new environment, install LiPD and the relevant utilities.
2) Provide a template for users to access infrormation from LiPD files through a generalised plotter notebook. This will involve: 
    - reading LiPD files 
    - Convert LiPD files to Excel
    - displaying the data on spatial and temporal scales and 
    - filtering variables.


## Background and Innovation  

Paleoclimatology is a highly collaborative field that relies on online databases for data sharing. However, accessing, analyzing, modelling and visualizing paleoclimate observations can be extremely time consuming, especially when dealing with large data volumes. To deal with this issue, the standardized LiPD (short for Linked PaleoData) framework was built for the quick and easy exchange of paleoclimate data amongst scientists. The package allows users to convert existing data into LiPD files, as well as analyze and manipulate LiPD data.

This package is still in development and there are only two relevant tutorials i could find: 
- https://github.com/nickmckay/LiPD-utilities/blob/master/Examples/Bchron.ipynb
- https://github.com/nickmckay/LiPD-utilities/blob/master/Examples/MD02-2515.McClymont.2012.Spectral.ipynb

But these make use of additional data analysis packages (e.g. Pyleoclim, Geochron), that require some dependencies unavailable to Windows.

My project will build on this existing documentation (more information can be found on the official [LiPD Utilitiesâ€™s documentation](https://nickmckay.github.io/LiPD-utilities/python/index.html) and [Linked Earth Wiki](http://wiki.linked.earth/Using_LiPD_files)). 

My aim for this project is to provide a simpler, more straight-foward documentation though a generalised plotter notebook that can help teach new users how to install and use the `LiPD` package, which can serve as a motivation for more scientists to make use of this package. 

## Resources & Timeline

Timeline
- I'll be using the existing package `LiPD` and it's existing documentation and [module contents](http://nickmckay.github.io/LiPD-utilities/python/source/lipd.html#module-lipd), as well as my previous experience with the package to help me write my code. I will build extra functionalities to use with this package. This is expected to take me about a week to do. 
- Writing the testing code will take me about 1 day.
- Writing the supporting documentation, docstrings, and reports might take me about 3 days.

Resources
- I will be downloading LiPD files from [NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/paleo-search/), [LinkedEarth Wiki](http://wiki.linked.earth/Main_Page) and [PANGAEA](https://www.pangaea.de/) and journal publications to test my notebooks.
- I will be in contact with my former supervisor Georgina Falster, who introduced me to this package and has helped me learn how to use it if I have any problems. 
- I will be using a GitHub repository to store my code.

This will be a one off project and I do not intend to continue in the future.


## Testing, validation, documentation

I will be conducting tests using both the `assert` function and the validation tests available within the `LiPD` package itself. These validation tests will be for the files themselves, whereas my tests will be for the functions I create. I will also be using some prebuilt functions from the `LiPD` package, but these work and there is no need to test them. 

Using the assert statement, I could test for: 
- whether the correct data has been loaded 
- whether specific variables exist within the LiPDs
- whether the maps return...
