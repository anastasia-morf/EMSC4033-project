# EMSC4033-project
My project for EMSC4033, 2022

Paleoclimatology is a highly collaborative field that relies on online databases for data sharing. However, accessing, analyzing, modelling and visualizing paleoclimate observations can be extremely time consuming, especially when dealing with large data volumes. 

`LiPD` (Linked Paleo Data) is a convenient tool that provides a standardized format for storing and exchanging paleoclimate data, enabling quick querying and extraction. But there are some tricks to know before we can use it.

The set of modules contained in this repository will give you and introduction to Python utilities for LiPDs. 

## Guide to the Repository 	
#### Jupyter Notebooks 
There are notebooks two contained in the repository: 
1. Installation.ipynb - Provides instructions to creating a new environment and installing `LiPD`.
2. GraphMaker.ipynb - Generalised plotter notebooks that teaches `LiPD` functionalities.

#### Resources 
Contains the `LiPD` files needed to run the code.

#### ProjectPlan.md 
The project plan - contains more information about this project (executive summary, requirements, timeline, review of existing codes and testing plan)

#### ProjectReport.md 
The project report contains the user instructions, list of dependencies, a description of the testing code, as well as limitations and future improvements.
